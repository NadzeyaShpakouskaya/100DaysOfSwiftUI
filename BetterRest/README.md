## Better sleep

The app suggests time when you should go to sleep for better rest.
It designed to help coffee drinkers get a good nightâ€™s sleep by asking them three questions:

1. When do they want to wake up?
2. Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
3. How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

It's a part of [100 Days of SwiftUI course.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
