## Rock, paper, scissor shoe game trainer.

It's the third project and a part of [100 Days of SwiftUI course.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

 - Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
 - Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
 - The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
 - If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
 - The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
